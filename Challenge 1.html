        <h1>The New Face of Education</h1>

        <pre>
            A world once bound by books alone,
            Now breathes through screens, in every home.
            Where knowledge flows like rivers wide,
            And technology stands as our guide.
        </pre>

        <pre> 
            No longer just the pen and page,
            The classroom breaks from ancient cage.
            With code and clicks, the mind expands,
            New horizons shaped by our own hands.
        </pre>

        <pre>    
            From distant lands, to distant skies,
            We witness truth with open eyes.
            A global pulse, a digital stream,
            Where every fact and every dream,
        </pre> 

        <pre>   
            Connects us all, from shore to shore,
            In ways we never knew before.
            To understand, to learn, to grow,
            Technology’s the key to know.
        </pre>

        <pre>    
            The world evolves at rapid pace,
            And knowledge wears a digital face.
            For every child, for every soul,
            Let this be the shared, united goal.
        </pre> 
        
        <pre>
            Embrace the screen, the code, the tool,
            For they shall build the future’s school.
            The new face of education bright,
            Leads us all into the light.
